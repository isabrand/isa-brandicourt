            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              <a>I am an electrical engineer and a marine biologist with a passion for our oceans and the health of our planet. I am looking forward to a career full of ocean engineering, research, and exploring Earth.</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
              <a>Throughout my undergraduate career at Northeastern University, I have had countless rewarding experiences including several co-op, or internships. When I am not learning or working, I like to write and edit science articles for a student magazine, go rock climbing, hiking, or skiing, and foster dogs. </a>

            <h2>Scientific Writing</h2>
            <p>
              <a>Being a part of NU Sci, Northeastern University's student-led science magazine, has given me the unique opportunity to research and publish articles on any topic I can dream up. I've used this avenue as a way to expand my focus from the ocean and explore topics in space, ecology, and social dynamics within the science field. <br><br>Additionally, as an editor for the past 2 years, I have had the incredible chance to work with many other talented writers and their chosen topics. This has been rewarding in the interpersonal aspect of helping develop new writer's voices as well as get to learn about their chosen research topics. After graduating from NU Sci, I hope to find similar avenues to express my excitement for science through writing that reaches a broad audience.</a>
