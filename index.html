            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am an electrical engineer and a marine biologist with a passion for our oceans and the health of our planet. I am looking forward to a career full of ocean engineering, research, and exploring Earth.</p>
            <p>Throughout my undergraduate career at Northeastern University, I have had countless rewarding experiences including several co-op, or internships. When I am not learning or working, I like to write and edit science articles for a student magazine, go rock climbing, hiking, or skiing, and foster dogs.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore this website and contact me with any inqueries!</p>

            <h2>Engineering Projects and Work</h2>
              <p>Through both classes and several co-ops (internships) at Northeastern University, I had some great opportunities to work on a wide variety of projects. Here are some of my favorites.<hr></p>
            <h3>Senior Capstone: A Low-Cost Acoustic Release</h3>
              <p>During the fall of 2023, I led a team of 5 other talented engineers to build a low-cost acoustic release. An acoustic release is a device to aid in ocean research. It allows scientists to deploy sensing equipment to the bottom of the ocean for extended periods of time and retrieve it when data collection is complete. Using acoustic communication to retrieve the device limits the typical use of invasive ropes and buoys.</p>
              <p>Our team developed both the physical device to be deployed into the ocean and a deck box for communication between the researcher and the device. This process combined hydrophones and acoustic signal communication in the ocean, system design with various sensors, motors, and battery management, digital design for a user interface, and many more aspects of system engineering.</p>
              <p>Personally, my main role was system design, build, and integration. I worked on the PCB builds, signal integrity testing, motor/mechanical design, and power management. Also as appointed team leader, I had the chance to practice leadership skills. I found this practice both challenging and rewarding, and was honored to receive the 1st Place Prize for our hard work at the end of the semester.</p>

            <h3>Autonomous Whale Observer for ships and coastlines</h3> 
              <p> </p>
            <h3>Autonomous Penguin Tracker for In-Situ Observations</h3> 
              <p> </p>
            <h3>Microbs: In-Situ Camera Systems for observation of penguin movement over sea-ice</h3>

            <h2>Scientific Writing</h2>
            <p>Being a part of NU Sci, Northeastern University's student-led science magazine, has given me the unique opportunity to research and publish articles on any topic I can dream up. I've used this avenue as a way to expand my focus from the ocean and explore topics in space, ecology, and social dynamics within the science field. <br><br>Additionally, as an editor for the past 2 years, I have had the incredible chance to work with many other talented writers. This has been rewarding in the interpersonal aspect of helping develop new writer's voices as well as getting to learn about their chosen topics. After graduating from NU Sci, I hope to find similar avenues to express my excitement for science through writing that reaches a broad audience.</p>
