            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am an electrical engineer and a marine biologist with a passion for our oceans and the health of our planet. I'm hoping to live a life full of ocean engineering, research, and exploring Earth.</p>
            <p>Throughout my undergraduate career at Northeastern University, I have had countless rewarding experiences including several co-op, or internships. Outside of the toils of our education system, I like to write and edit science articles, go rock climbing, hiking, or skiing, bake sweet treats for my roommates, and foster dogs.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore this website and contact me with any inqueries about any and all of it. I love questions and meeting people, so don't hesitate!</p>

            <h2>Engineering Projects and Work</h2>
              <p>Through both classes and several co-ops (internships) at Northeastern University, I had some great opportunities to work on a wide variety of projects. Here are some of my favorites.<hr></p>
            <h3>Senior Capstone: A Low-Cost Acoustic Release</h3>
              <p>During the fall of 2023, I led a team of 5 other talented engineers to build a low-cost acoustic release. An acoustic release is a device to aid in ocean research. It allows scientists to deploy sensing equipment to the bottom of the ocean for extended periods of time and retrieve it when data collection is complete. Using acoustic communication to retrieve the device limits the typical use of invasive ropes and buoys.</p>
              <p>Our team developed both the physical device to be deployed into the ocean and a deck box for communication between the researcher and the device. This process combined hydrophones and acoustic signal communication in the ocean, system design with various sensors, motors, and battery management, digital design for a user interface, and many more aspects of system engineering.</p>
              <p>Personally, my main role was system design, build, and integration. I worked on the PCB builds, signal integrity testing, motor/mechanical design, and power management. Also as appointed team leader, I had the chance to practice leadership skills. I found this practice both challenging and rewarding, and was honored to receive the 1st Place Prize for our hard work at the end of the semester.</p>
            <h3>Carrier Board for a Harvesting Drone</h3>
              <p>At my third co-op, GreenSight, I learned how to design PCB schematics and layouts in KiCad, culminating in this carrier board project. A carrier board allows the seamless use of smaller, off-the-shelf boards into your system without the use of excessive and unreliable cabling. The purpose of this board was to use an input of 48V to power four motor control boards and a microcontroller. The board was designed for ease of use within the system, interchangeability of components, and power protection.</p>
            <h3>Autonomous Whale Observer for ships and coastlines</h3> 
              <p>At my second co-op, continuing at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, I worked on a whale spotting system. Ship strikes are a leading cause of death for many whale species, right alongside rope/buoy entanglement. By implementing a watch-dog type system aboard a vessel, we can better detect and avoid whales, saving both valuable lives and expensive damage to a ship. The system consisted of an array of infrared cameras, a normal camera, all on gimballed platforms, and the associated electronics boxes to control the cameras. My main role was to design a housing for the on-ship camera system, as well as build and configure it for deployment. I used SolidWorks to design the housing, integrating the existing system architecture into my build. I built and tested the whole system and deployed it in Nova Scotia on a cruise vessel.</p>
            <h3>Autonomous Penguin Tracker for in-situ observations</h3> 
              <p>As somewhat on an independent study project after my semester of marine biology courses, I lived in Monaco for a month working with the Centre Scientifique de Monaco. The penguin colony that I had worked with in Antarctica has a monitoring camera system that has been operating for over 10 years. This system stores continual footage of the entire colony, split into two views. An ongoing challenge in the lab has been how to track specific penguins from one of the two entrances of the colony to their nest. I explored this challenge using Adam Harley's open sourced PIPs code (<a href="https://github.com/aharley/pips/" target="_blank">persistent independent particles</a>). </p>
            <h3>Adelie penguin handling</h3> 
              <p>As an unexpected component of my field-work in Antarctica, I became one of the main members of the ornithology team tasked with completing important biological procedures before the penguins returned to the sea for the winter. I had never worked with anything like a penguin before, the extent of my animal handling being dogs, guinea pigs, snakes, and turtles... It was a fast but necessary learning process, and I owe a lot to my mentors who were on the base with me. We had one newer procedure which required securing a specific penguin at the precise moment that they left the colony before they made it to the ocean. Once the adult was secured, we had a short amount of time to obtain physiology measurements, attach a monitoring tag, and draw blood. The second, annual procedure required the tagging of every single new chick with an RFID tag. This is for the purpose of keeping track of this specific colony over time, the health of certain lineages, breeding success, etc. With over 200 Adelie chicks to tag, this was a huge chunk of work. I am so honored to have been trusted with this opportunity and had a fantastic time learning from the ornithologists.</p>
            <h3>Microbs: In-Situ Camera Systems for Adelie penguin observation</h3> 
              <p>My main task in Antarctica was to build and deploy a series of three ethernet-connected cameras onto different buildings on the base. These cameras would be set up to observe specific areas of sea-ice with the goal of recording how fast penguins are moving to or from the colony.</p>

            <h2>Scientific Writing</h2>
            <p>Being a part of NU Sci, Northeastern University's student-led science magazine, has given me the unique opportunity to research and publish articles on any topic I can dream up. I've used this avenue as a way to expand my focus from the ocean and explore topics in space, ecology, and social dynamics within the science field.</p>
            <p>Additionally, as an editor for the past 2 years, I have had the incredible chance to work with many other talented writers. This has been rewarding in the interpersonal aspect of helping develop new writer's voices as well as getting to learn about their chosen topics. After graduating from NU Sci, I hope to find similar avenues to express my excitement for science through writing that reaches a broad audience.<hr></p>
            <h3>Our brains on psychedelics: Getting creative in the treatment of mental illnesses  -  Published December 1, 2023</h3>
            <p>Bill Wilson co-founded Alcoholics Anonymous in the 1930s. He had struggled with alcoholism since his early twenties and depression even longer. But while AA helped Wilson recover from alcoholism, he remained frustrated with available mental health treatments. So, in the ‘50s, he began collaborating with psychologist Betty Eisner and discovered the power of LSD.

            <p>While the wooly mammoths, smilodons, and giant ground sloths starred in Disney’s “Ice Age,” do prehistoric creatures have a place on Earth today? When species go extinct, evolution fills the ecosystem gap with modern species, renewing balance and moving forward in evolutionary history. The hot-topic term “de-extinction” describes the process of using genetic engineering to <a href="https://nuscimagazine.com/reincarnation-dodo-or-do-dont/" target="_blank">[read more]<br></a></p>

            <p>While the idea of spending three months of co-op in Antarctica sounds isolating and lonely, it is, in fact, the opposite. I discovered this while on my co-op from December 2021 to March 2022 working with the French Polar Institute to improve long-term penguin observation systems.

            <p>Although society has seemingly made leaps and bounds over the past century in terms of overall gender equality, the scientific field is still far from balanced. Yes, the early 1900s began with a minuscule number of recognized women in any field of science, but even now, the United Nations <a href="https://nuscimagazine.com/women-in-science-should-not-be-oxymoronic/" target="_blank">[read more]<br></a></p>

            <h3>Solo Backpacking Trek - West Highland Way, Scotland - August 2023</h3>
            <p> The West Highland Way is a popular 96-mile long trek extending north from Glasgow, Scotland. It passes through beautiful lochs, peaceful towns, rolling moorlands, and impressive mountains. I completed around 70 miles of the trek in 5 days, starting in Rowardennan and ending up in Fort William. </p>
            <p> While not without challenges, I generally find solo hiking trips to be a phenomenal time. I love the opportunity to meet fellow wanderers, move at my own pace, and practice a meditative mentality while physically exercising my body. Enjoy these photos that I took while on the trek and the story snippets that accompany them.</p>

            <p>In order to complete my minor in marine biology amidst an engineering intense courseload, I took a whole semester off to focus solely on marine bio. I joined a cohort of 12 other students and we spent two months in Nahant, MA; Friday Harbor, WA; and Bocas del Toro, Panama. Each of these places was wildly unique and had so much to offer in terms of natural beauty, ocean ecosystems, and culture. </p>
