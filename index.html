            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am an electrical engineer and a marine biologist with a passion for our oceans and the health of our planet. I'm hoping to live a life full of ocean engineering, research, and exploring Earth.</p>
            <p>Throughout my undergraduate career at Northeastern University, I have had countless rewarding experiences including several co-ops, or internships. These have been remarkable in helping me hone my passions and what I would like out of a career. Alongside the toils of our education system, I like to write and edit science articles, go rock climbing, hiking, or skiing, bake sweet treats for my roommates, and take care of foster dogs.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore this website and contact me with any inqueries about any and all of it. I love questions!</p>

            <h2>Engineering Projects and Work</h2>
              <p>Here are some of my favorite projects that I worked on throughout undergrad.<hr></p>
            <h3>Senior Capstone: A Low-Cost Acoustic Release</h3>
              <p>During the fall of 2023, I led a team of 5 other talented engineers to build a low-cost acoustic release. An acoustic release is a device to aid in ocean research. It allows scientists to deploy sensing equipment to the bottom of the ocean for extended periods of time and recall it when data collection is complete. Using acoustic communication to retrieve the device limits the typical use of invasive ropes and buoys, which lead to entanglement and litter.</p>
              <p>Our team developed both the physical device to be deployed into the ocean and a deck box for communication between the researcher and the device. This process combined hydrophones and acoustic signal communication in the ocean, system design with various sensors, motors, and battery management, digital design for a user interface, and many more aspects of system engineering.</p>
              <p>Personally, my main role was system design, build, and integration. I worked on the PCB builds, signal integrity testing, motor/mechanical design, and power management. Also as appointed team leader, I had the chance to practice leadership skills. I found this both challenging and rewarding, and was honored for our team to receive the 1st Place Prize for our hard work at the end of the semester.</p>
            <h3>Carrier Board for a Harvesting Drone</h3>
              <p>At my third co-op, GreenSight, I learned how to design PCB schematics and layouts in KiCad, culminating in this carrier board project. A carrier board allows the seamless use of smaller, off-the-shelf boards into your system without the use of excessive and unreliable cabling. The purpose of this board was to use an input of 48V to power four motor control boards and a microcontroller. The board was designed for ease of use within the system, interchangeability of components, and power protection.</p>
            <h3>Autonomous Whale Observer for ships and coastlines</h3> 
              <p>At my second co-op, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, I worked on a whale spotting system. Ship strikes are a leading cause of death for many whale species, right alongside rope/buoy entanglement. By implementing a watch-dog type system aboard a vessel, we can better detect and avoid whales, saving both valuable lives and expensive damage to a ship. The system consisted of an array of infrared cameras, a normal camera, all on gimballed platforms, and the associated electronics boxes to control the cameras. My main role was to design a housing for the on-ship camera system, as well as build and configure it for deployment. I used SolidWorks to design the housing, integrating the existing system architecture into my build. I built and tested the whole system and deployed it in Nova Scotia on a cruise vessel.</p>
            <h3>Autonomous Penguin Tracker for in-situ observations</h3> 
              <p>As somewhat on an independent study project after my semester of marine biology courses, I lived in Monaco for a month working with the Centre Scientifique de Monaco. The penguin colony that I had worked with in Antarctica has a monitoring camera system that has been operating for over 10 years. This system stores continual footage of the entire colony, split into two views. An ongoing challenge in the lab has been how to track specific penguins from one of the two entrances of the colony to their nest. I explored this challenge using Adam Harley's open sourced PIPs code (<a href="https://github.com/aharley/pips/" target="_blank">persistent independent particles</a>). </p>
            <h3>Adelie penguin handling</h3> 
              <p>As an unexpected component of my field-work in Antarctica, I became one of the main members of the ornithology team tasked with completing important biological procedures before Adelie penguins returned to the sea for the winter. I had never worked with anything like a penguin before, the extent of my animal handling being dogs, guinea pigs, snakes, and turtles... It was a fast but necessary learning process, and I owe a lot to my mentors who were on the base with me. We also conducted a more unique procedure which required securing a specific penguin at the precise moment that they left the colony before they made it to the ocean. My skill in running through jagged ice and snow in big boots were therefore honed. Once the adult was secured, we had a short amount of time to obtain physiology measurements, attach a monitoring tag, and draw blood. The second, annual procedure required the tagging of every single new chick with an RFID tag. This is for the purpose of keeping track of this specific colony over time, the health of certain lineages, breeding success, etc. With over 200 Adelie chicks to tag, this was a huge chunk of work. I am so honored to have been trusted with this opportunity and had a fantastic time learning from the ornithologists.</p>
            <h3>Microbs: In-Situ Camera Systems for Adelie penguin observation</h3> 
              <p>My main task in Antarctica was to build and deploy a series of three ethernet-connected cameras onto different buildings across the base. These cameras would be set up to observe specific areas of sea-ice with the goal of recording how fast Adelie penguins are moving to or from the colony. While the engineering aspect of this project was relatively straightforward as the system had already been designed, the science coordination piece was a hurdle. On the French base, where everyone spoke and worked in French, my barely fluent ability was really put to the test. I learned a completely new set of vocabulary and advocated for myself when someone was speaking too quickly and I didn't understand. My French quickly improved and I was able to successfully communicate everything I needed for my project, but not without a lot of hard work and frustration!</p>

            <h2>Scientific Writing</h2>
            <p>Being a part of NU Sci, Northeastern University's student-led science magazine, has given me the unique opportunity to research and publish articles on any topic I can dream up. I've used this avenue as a way to expand my focus from the ocean and explore topics in space, ecology, and social dynamics within the science field.</p>
            <p>Additionally, as an editor for the past 2 years, I have had the incredible chance to work with many other talented writers. This has been rewarding in the interpersonal aspect of helping develop new writer's voices as well as getting to learn about their chosen topics. After graduating from NU Sci, I hope to find similar avenues to express my excitement for science through writing that reaches a broad audience.<hr></p>

            <h3>Solo Backpacking Trek - West Highland Way, Scotland - August 2023</h3>
            <p> The West Highland Way is a popular 96-mile long trek extending north from Glasgow, Scotland. It passes through beautiful lochs, peaceful towns, rolling moorlands, and impressive mountains. I completed around 70 miles of the trek in 5 days, starting in Rowardennan and ending up in Fort William. </p>
            <p> While not without challenges, I generally find solo hiking trips to be a phenomenal time. I love the opportunity to meet fellow wanderers, move at my own pace, and practice a meditative mentality while physically exercising my body. Enjoy these photos that I took while on the trek and the story snippets that accompany them.</p>

            </div>
            <p>These photos are from the first three days of my trek, the loch section. The terrain was a dense woodland right on the edge of the crystalline Loch Lomond. I crossed with many other hikers, and stopped many times to pick blackberries by the side of the trail.</p>

            </div>
            <p>These photos are from the second day of my trek, hiking out of the lochs and up into the highlands. I passed over several brooks and streams before following the old military road up into sheep territory. There was even a brief stretch through a pine forest where I was grateful for the branches to ward off some rain showers. Red fairy mushrooms littered the underbrush and everything was very quiet.</p>

            <p>I thought things couldn't get better but then they did. I stumbled out onto Rannoch Moor after a 17 mile day to be accosted by wind and the threat of a heavy rain. As I kept walking along the military road, I gambled with the sky on when to pitch camp. My gamble paid off and no sooner had I tucked my boots under the awning of the tent than the clouds unleashed a torrent of water. I huddled inside my tent, munching on a cheese wrap and reading my book until the rain subsided. Clambering out of my tent, I was met with a full rainbow stretched over the moor. The breeze was enough to keep the bugs at bay and I happily sat in the grass, marveling at the Earth until sunset. </p>

            <div class="img-container">

              <img src="./images/highlands4.JPG">
            </div>
            <p>Hiking out of the moor, I was welcomed into the thick of the highlands with gorgeous views of mountains around every turn. Although there was more elevation in this last section, my legs and feet were used to the long days by now, and I had plenty of cheese and peanut butter wraps for fuel. Near the end, I had the choice to split my remaining mileage into a 10 and 7 mile day, or complete the trek a day early. About a mile in, I met a Scottish gentleman who hiked the trek in its entirety every month. We were on a flat stretch of trail and as he engaged in conversation, I slightly sped up to fall in step. We spoke about his family in the United States, his wife and the car buisness he was long since retired from, and what keeps him going in life. He told me stories of the two ancient women who live on a farm up in these highlands and refuse to leave. Well above 95, they are fit as fiddles and plan to stay there for many years still. What keeps them healthy I asked - raw goat's milk and no telephones was the response. Suddenly I realized that I had been pushing my pace all morning to keep up with this man and his stories of old Scotland. I was 9 miles through and it was not even lunchtime. The Scot did not stop for lunch, so we parted ways and I planned the rest of my trek. Getting to Fort William a day early allowed me to head back to Glasgow a day early as well and spend a little time in the city.</p>
            <p>I made it back to Glasgow and cleaned up from my trek. The first shower always renders me a completely different person and this time was  no different. My chosen reacclimation to society was a Glasgow pub crawl of live music venues, as it was a Saturday night, so what else could I possibly do. I started off with a pub advertising swing music and found a plethora of retirees dancing to Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Nat King Cole tunes sung by a huge man sporting a fedora and vest combo. I befriended two women at the bar who were out on the prowl and watched them successfully pick up men for the night and leave for the drag show up the road. Life aspiration right there. Next, I happened upon a corner pub and was lured in by the dulcet tones of Tennessee Whiskey. Sadly, it was that singer's last tune, but the next band did not disappoint. They pulled out a trumpet and accordion, filling the dimly lit space with jazz funk music, reminiscent of New Orleans. I kept wandering and found a basement cafe lounge, my resting place for the night. The space was better lit than your typical pub, and full of couches and armchairs surrounding the stage. The singer had a strong voice, and she made you feel like singing along even if you didn't know the lyrics. I relaxed for the rest of their set, getting up to dance with everyone for their ending zinger, I Will Survive. The next day I made my way home to Boston, sure that this would not be the last time I visited Scotland.</p>

            <p>In order to complete my minor in marine biology amidst an engineering intense courseload, I took a whole semester off to focus solely on marine bio. I joined a cohort of 12 other students and we spent two months in Nahant, MA; Friday Harbor, WA; and Bocas del Toro, Panama. Each of these places was wildly unique and had so much to offer in terms of natural beauty, ocean ecosystems, and culture. </p>

            <p>While I was in Antarctica technically for work, it was also an incredible travel adventure. Not only was I culturally immersed in a French work and social atmosphere, but I was surrounded by some of the most interesting people I had ever met. Technicians who returned to Antarctica year after year to construct buildings and do maintenance to keep the base running, chefs and bakers who had were masters of French cuisine, scientists who were much more versed in polar sciences than I, even an Anthropologist with whom I shared a name. The journey started aboard the Astrolabe, a French military ice-breaker. We spent a peaceful (unless you were a victim of sea sickness) 7 days floating from Tasmania down to the base. During the voyage, I realized how little French I actually knew and played a lot, I mean a LOT of backgammon.</p>

            <p>As I continued practicing my French at communal dinners and social times, I made some good friends and learned a lot from the people there. Two of those good friends were Manu, a meteorologist, and Jerome, the chef. Part of Manu's job was to release these massive weather balloons each day, which relayed wind, temperature, and particulate matter information back to their station. I released one of these weather balloons with Jerome to celebrate the New Year! As is tradition at the base, we held a few polar plunges, choosing a sunny day to vault into the frigid ocean and blast our nervous systems with the shock. My closest friend Adelie and I plunged together, luxuriating in the feeling of pins and needles as our bodies adjusted to the temperature. But life at the base wasn't all play. As a small group of people living together in isolation, there were certain jobs that were required of us in order to keep everything running smoothly. Chores were given on a weekly basis to a rotation of people, known as "service base." When the kitchen needed restocking, the whole base came together to form a long line from the freezers to the main eating room. Cartons of eggs, fruits, vegetables, and pounds upon pounds of butter were passed from hand to hand until they safely reached the kitchen.</p>

            <p>One of my favorite parts of living in Antarctica for a few months was the "Planet Earth" like environment that I was privy to. Surrounded by some of the most uniquely adapted creatures in the world, I could spend hours outside walking around and observing the skuas, petrels, and penguins. Especially as the penguin chicks began to hatch into tasty snacks for the skuas, I could watch an entire hunt from start to finish. A chick gets too independent and wanders away from the safety of the rest and a skua locks in. Circling and diving to grab at the chick with its talons, it's met by a horde of angry adult Adelies. They puff up their chests and peck at the diving skua, forming a ring around the defenseless chick. Eventually, their spunk wins out and the skua flies off. Another exciting, yet rarer encounter I witnessed was a leopard seal's attack in the nearby ocean inlet. Spy-hopping up to get a lay of the land, the leopard seal swam silently and smoothly through the bright blue water, barely rustling the surface. While most of the penguins huddle together nervously on the sea-ice, a few take their chances and dive in. Moments later, the leopard seal breaks the surface of the water, the Adelie gripped in her jaws. She slings her head from side to side, slapping the penguin's body on the surface of the water, then dives down again. The technique was clearly practiced and purposeful, and we all watched in awe throughout the entire event, until nothing remained of the penguin but a muddied spot in the bright blue water.</p>

            <p>I cannot express how much I grew as a person and a scientist during my time in Antarctica. I loved it there and can't wait for more adventures like this.</p>
